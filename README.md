The TA sessions this semester will focus on coding practice.

Attendance will be checked through weekly quizzes based on example codes, which must be submitted.

The answers to the quizzes will be uploaded after each session.

If you have any questions, please send an email to olr.or@yonsei.ac.kr. (Questions will only be accepted via email.)

The example codes and quizzes are designed to help with the midterm and final exams, as well as assignments and problem-solving.

Please refrain from sharing them externally.
